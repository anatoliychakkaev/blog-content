# How to contribute

This page describes in details process of contributing to this blog. Basically
all you need to help me - github account and english skills. And I promise to put
your name under article if you want.

So, let's overview process in details.

## Forking

Let's say you've found a typo in [My blogging
engine](/blog/my-blogging-engine.html) article. You can find a link "[fix this
article](https://github.com/anatoliychakkaev/blog-content/blob/master/articles/my-blogging-engine.md)"

article source text.

When you are on the github and logged in you can fork repository to your
personal account and fix this article directly in the github web interface.

## Submitting your changes

When you are done editing all you need is just click "Submit pull request". This
will notify me about your changes, and I will publish it immediately after
receiving and reviewing.

## Adding your name as co-author

I really appreciate your help on improving my blog and thank you by listing your
github username below the article. If you want your name to be listed you just
need it to "fixed by" header list, like that:
