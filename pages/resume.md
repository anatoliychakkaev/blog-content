## Background skills

I'm full-stack developer with 7+ years of experience, so I'm familiar
with client and server technologies - everything related to web, from HTTP to CSS.
But understanding all tech stack gives me strong understanding of my field of battle:
javascript and nodejs.

I'm good at architect, leading team, making good design solutions (design as both UX and
code design).

## Work experience

### 2008 - present time: Lead Nodejs Developer at Flatsoft, LLC

NodeJS, RoR, PHP, Javascript

Flatsoft is outsourcing company, working here for 3 years, starting from PHP developer,
then moved to Lead Developer position, and then started to work with nodejs only.
During that period I've participate in tons of projects: social networks, facebook games,
web shops. Couple projects where I lead team:

- https://www.everloop.com/ (ruby on rails, social network)
- http://www.productmadness.com/ (ruby on rails, facebook games, high load)
- http://www.dropsend.com/ (php, high load)
- http://sonicliving.com/ (nodejs, web crawlers)

For the last year I collaborated with sonicliving: writing semantic parsers for tons of
music websites, it was really boring work, but it allows me to learn lots of details about
crawling web, using different ways to interact with datasources.

In dropsend I've learned very much about file sharing/sending through the web, managing
large amount of data. My team build whole OAuth API for dropsend, it was really interesting
to learn and implement everything from scratch.

Work with productmadness was really challengy due to highload. I've learned about scaling,
large deployments, performance monitoring in newrelic (later I've started writing my own
newrelic for nodejs, but it was abandoned, have no time for it).

In general, work in Flatsoft was really interesting, I've learn almost everything I know
(except php, mysql, mssql):

- how to work with team
- how lead the team
- agile
- highload
- rails
- vim, linux, osx
- and of course nodejs - my biggest love

### 2011 - present time: part time freelance, NodeJS + opensource

While working as freelancer the most exciting thing I've found - opensource, my main
project RailwayJS allows me to learn how to deal with community, how to provide best
support to my users, write documentation, write clean and robust code, read and understand
tons of foreign code. I've also found my clear vision about the best way of software
building: keeping things clean, modular and as simple as possible. There's a lot of good
books about this coding philosophy like Complete Code by Steve Mcconnell, but it's not
enough to read the book - need to find own way to Complete Code.

## Opensource projects

I'm author and maintainer of following opensource projects (all nodejs)
All listed here: https://github.com/1602

- RailwayJS - MVC framework - http://railwayjs.com
- JugglingDB - multidatabase ORM for nodejs
- jsdoc.info - online documentation generator for nodejs projects - http://jsdoc.info
- roco - deployment tool
- makedoc - standalone documentation generator
- semicov - test coverage tool
- seedjs - database seeds for jugglingdb

All of this projects authored since Jan 2011, when I started to work on nodejs intensively.
Now I've pause on opensource because of my freelance work on startup.

### 2005 - 2008: Lead PHP Developer at Academy of Management, Kazan

This is my first workplace, where I've started to work when I was student. Started from
junior php and Deplhi developer, ended as Lead PHP Developer, which knows everything, and
ready to work with any code :)

## Present state

Currently I happy with learning nodejs, contributing to opensource projects and supporting
some of my homegrown projects like jsdoc.info. Also I thinking about starting to work in
world-changing startup (in process of negotiations with co-founders). From the summer of
2012 I leaving my current job at Flatsoft to have more time for my projects. And I open to
job applications, but I'm not looking for a job to "just work", I need something challengy
and interesting where I can realize all my talent as nodejs developer.
