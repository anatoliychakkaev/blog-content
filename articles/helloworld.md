Today is 19 Jun 2012 and this is a big day, because I'm leaving FlatSoft and will
continue my career as independent [web-engineer](/about). Also I starting this
personal website for tech notes and presenting my projects.

## Bye FlatSoft

I worked in FS for 3 years (end 2008 - middle 2012), and it was great days because
I met my love - nodejs and have a great chance to work on big projects with
talented guys. But after 3 years of outsourcing I get tired. I need a product
- this is why I quit FS and going to start working on startup. Also I will continue
contibuting my opensource projects (railwayjs, jugglingdb, jsdoc.info, and others).

## Bye 9 to 5

I believe every good programmer working 9 to 5 should quit some day. Because real
programming is not 9 to 5 - first of all it's love. When you working on project
you should think about it as much as it requires: in shower, while driving a car,
even climbing to Everest or skiing down at 60mph. Life-changing idea can come at
any time and you should be ready to give it all your talent immediately.

For me it means one project at a time (which is impossible in opensource or couple
part-time jobs, when you spent half of day in one project and half in another). In
edge case I can spent whole day helping someone with project, but 1 project between
sleeps - this is a restriction. This is why I prefer daily contracts rather then
houly. Working hourly is good enough, but it keeps me in permanent stress -- I
should always remember about my estimations (I'm totally crazy about time and
task estimations). Sometimes I just need to relax and figure out
elegant solution, but it's almost impossible when you thinking about time
restrictions estimated in paid hours.

And I'm really happy to work without this constraints. And I'm more productive when
I'm happy. As a result we have better solutions, better code and satisfied client.
